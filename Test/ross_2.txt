With practice comes confidence
It's almost like something out of a fairytale book
You can get away with a lot
Let's build some happy little clouds up here
We'll make some happy little bushes here
If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path
In this world, everything can be happy
If you hypnotize it, it will go away
Let your heart be your guide
Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy
If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree
This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life
Let the paint work
All you have to learn here is how to have fun
I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us
No worries
No cares
Even trees need a friend
We all need friends
We artists are a different breed of people
We're a happy bunch
Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is
Now it's beginning to make a little sense
Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too
You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting
I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush
It's life
It's interesting
It's fun
This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart
See
We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth
We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants
Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now
There are no mistakes
You can fix anything that happens
Don't fiddle with it all day
Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here
You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful
And just raise cain
It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat
Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death
Absolutely no pressure
You are just a whisper floating across a mountain
But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it
In your world you can create anything you desire
Pretend you're water
Just floating without any effort
Having a good day
The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it
This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life
Be brave
Very easy to work these to death
The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it
See it finished in your mind before you ever start
Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger
The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job
We don't need any guidelines or formats
All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us
Don't hurry
Take your time and enjoy
You can't make a mistake
Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it
The least little bit can do so much
Everyone needs a friend
Friends are the most valuable things in the world
I like to beat the brush
This is unplanned it really just happens
Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds
